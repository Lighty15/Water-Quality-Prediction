# Water-Quality-Prediction
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict whether water is safe for drinking based on physicochemical properties such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Sulfate, Conductivity and more. It supports Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) by providing an AI-powered approach to monitor and ensure safe water quality.
